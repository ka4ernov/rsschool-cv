## About myself:

I am 34 years old lawyer, that wants to study web development. After 12 years of law practice in real estate, I have decided to dive into the world of programming. I have started learning programming by using udemy and youtube courses. I even achieved some success in html, css, javascript and react. But finally, I realized that for better upgrade of myself I need more consistent way to study, more structured materials, and mentor. I hope to find these missing things in RS School.
